rc is a bundle of **skills, slash commands, hooks, and agents** that drive the full lifecycle of AI-assisted development — product ideation (PRD), technical specification, codebase-informed task breakdown, task execution, and PR-review remediation — directly inside your coding agent.

Everything here is **plain markdown and shell**. There is no binary to install and nothing to build: the skills run inside Claude Code or OpenCode, the commands are slash commands, and the hooks are shell scripts your agent invokes at lifecycle events.

## 📦 Install

### Claude Code (plugin marketplace)

```text
/plugin marketplace add rodolfochicone/rc-project   # register the marketplace
/plugin install rc@rc-project                       # install the plugin
```

Plugin skills are namespaced under the plugin, so slash commands surface as `/rc:rc-create-prd`, `/rc:rc-create-techspec`, `/rc:rc-create-tasks`, `/rc:rc-review-round`, and so on. Update with `/plugin marketplace update`.

The plugin ships from this repo's layout (`skills/`, `commands/`, `agents/`, `hooks/hooks.json`) — Claude Code discovers them by convention. See [`docs/claude-code-plugin.md`](docs/claude-code-plugin.md) for the full runbook.

> **Repo is private.** `/plugin marketplace add` clones this repository, so the Claude Code environment needs GitHub read access — sign in with `gh auth login` or export `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` before adding the marketplace.

### OpenCode

OpenCode reads agents, commands, and plugins from its config directory. Copy the `opencode/` bundle into place:

```bash
# Project-local (recommended)
cp -R opencode/agent    .opencode/agent
cp -R opencode/commands .opencode/command
cp -R opencode/plugin   .opencode/plugin

# or global
cp -R opencode/agent    ~/.config/opencode/agent
cp -R opencode/commands ~/.config/opencode/command
cp -R opencode/plugin   ~/.config/opencode/plugin
```

The `opencode/plugin/rc-hooks.ts` plugin gives OpenCode Claude-parity hook enforcement by shelling out to the shared scripts under `hooks/scripts/`.

## 🛠️ Skills

The core pipeline — Idea → PRD → TechSpec → Tasks → Execution → Review — where each phase produces plain markdown artifacts under `.rc/tasks/<name>/` that feed the next:

| Skill                  | Purpose                                                             |

## ⌨️ Slash commands

Claude Code commands (`commands/`) and OpenCode commands (`opencode/commands/`) route to the skills:

`/rc-plan` · `/rc-exec` · `/rc-pipe` · `/rc-review` · `/rc-git` · `/rc-gan` · `/rc-docs` (Claude) · `/rc-prd` · `/rc-techspec` · `/rc-tasks` · `/rc-fix` (OpenCode)

## 🤖 Agents

One agent per pipeline phase plus two read-only support agents, each pinning a model to its role. In Claude Code they live under `agents/` (invoke via the Task tool or `@rc-*`); in OpenCode under `opencode/agent/`. The `rc` agent orchestrates the rest.

| Agent          | Role                                    | Model  |

## 🪝 Hooks

Shell hooks under `hooks/scripts/`, wired in `hooks/hooks.json` (Claude Code) and mirrored by `opencode/plugin/rc-hooks.ts` (OpenCode):

| Hook                     | Event         | Enforces                                                  |

| `observe.sh`             | PostToolUse   | Records tool observations for `rc-instincts`             |
| `session-recall.sh`      | SessionStart  | Recalls project memory into the session                   |
| `phase-reminder.sh`      | SessionStart  | Reminds the active workflow's pipeline phase and next step |

> The Go-specific hooks (`go-mod-guard`, `go-fmt`) only act inside Go projects; they are no-ops elsewhere.
