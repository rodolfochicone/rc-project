# Capability Reference

Capabilities declare intent in the manifest and become enforceable runtime grants during `initialize`.

## Manifest shape

```toml
[security]
capabilities = ["prompt.mutate", "tasks.read"]
```

## Negotiation rules

- The manifest declares the requested capability list.
- The operator confirms that list at install time.
- The runtime sends the confirmed list in `initialize.granted_capabilities`.
- The extension replies with `accepted_capabilities`, which must be a subset of the granted list.

If the extension accepts a capability it was not granted, the host rejects the session.

## Practical guidance

- Request the smallest capability set that makes the extension work.
- Separate declarative extensions from executable ones when possible.
- Treat advisory capabilities as documentation and audit aids, not sandbox guarantees.
