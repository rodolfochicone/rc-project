</details>

**Path traversal vulnerability in file operation handlers.**

The `ReadTextFile` and `WriteTextFile` handlers accept agent-provided paths without validation. Since these are ACP request handlers called by the agent subprocess, a malicious or buggy agent could request files outside the intended working directory. While the agent is typically trusted (Claude, Codex, etc.), path validation is a standard security practice given that these methods operate on the filesystem.

Additionally, `WriteTextFile` uses hardcoded `0o600` permissions instead of preserving the original file's permissions when overwriting, which may alter access control on existing files unintentionally.

Consider validating paths against the session's working directory (available from `SessionRequest.WorkingDir` during session creation) and preserving file permissions when overwriting existing files.

Verify each finding against the current code and only fix it if needed.

In `@internal/core/agent/client.go` around lines 196 - 229, ReadTextFile and
WriteTextFile accept unvalidated agent-supplied paths, enabling path traversal;
fix by resolving params.Path against the session working directory (use the
stored SessionRequest.WorkingDir from session creation), compute an absolute
path (filepath.Abs or filepath.Join(workingDir, params.Path)), then ensure the
resolved path is contained within the workingDir (e.g., filepath.Rel and reject
if it begins with ".."); for WriteTextFile also preserve existing file
permissions when overwriting by calling os.Stat on the target (if it exists) to
get FileMode and use that mode instead of hardcoded 0o600 when calling
os.WriteFile; return a clear error if validation fails.

## Triage

- Decision: `valid`
- Rationale: The current `ReadTextFile` and `WriteTextFile` handlers trust `params.Path` directly even though ACP includes `SessionId` on both requests and RC already knows each session's working directory. That means a buggy adapter can read or overwrite files outside the session root, and overwrite mode is always reset to `0o600` even when updating an existing file.
- Fix plan: Store the resolved working directory on each session, resolve file requests through the session identified by `params.SessionId`, reject paths outside that root, and preserve an existing file's mode on overwrite.
- Resolution: `clientImpl` now records per-session file roots, scopes read/write requests through `params.SessionId`, rejects paths outside the allowed roots, and preserves the existing file mode when overwriting tracked files. `make verify` passed after adding client helper coverage for allowed roots, relative paths, outside-root rejection, unknown sessions, and permission preservation.
